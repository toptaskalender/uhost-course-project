## uHost Course Project

uHost is a course project designed for [CSS - The Complete Guide 2021 (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [Manuel Lorenz](https://twitter.com/academind_real). I completed their course and coded along with them throughout the course.
